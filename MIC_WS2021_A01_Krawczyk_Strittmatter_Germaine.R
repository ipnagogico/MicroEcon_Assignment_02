### Problem 1: Logit Model ###

# remove observations with NAs for Age

# Estimating the model

## 1d: bootstrap

# We store the number of replications and observations we use in the bootstrap

# We create a matrix to store the coefficients from the bootstrap; each row is one
# replication, the two columns for the two coefficients

  # to make it replicable, we use set.seed to have replicable randomness

# create a matrix and append a column of 1s for multiplication further on
fare_poss_mat <- cbind(rep(1, length(fare_poss)), 
                       fare_poss)

# we now create the confidence intervals by taking the 2.5% and 97.5% quantile

# 1e: Interpretation
# have a look at the value:
filter(conf_plot, Fare == 100)

# Assuming our model does depict the true data-generating process,
# with a probability of 95%, the true (population) probability of having survived the sinking of the titanic,
# conditional on having paid a fare of 100 dollars, lies between ~upper~ and ~lower~


### Problem 2: Probit Model ###

titanic2 <- read.dta("titanic.dta")
str(titanic2)


lm3 <- survived ~ class + age + sex

prob_reg <- glm(lm3, family = binomial(link = "probit"), data = titanic2)
summary(prob_reg)

# the probability of survival "decreases when the person becomes a man" - conforms to expectation ("children and women first")


## 2b
# ML estimation for betas
# Mean of X values - how for nominal data
# normalpdf(linear index) * beta_sexman

# see felix' answer, but: it's not on marginal change but discrete (or any) change

# no, assuming binarity of sex (which the data does) there is no infinitesimally small change in sex, only a discrete one

## 2c
# I think: turn nominal value (4 possible values: 3classes+crew) into binary (1st class vs not 1st class)

## 2d
# I think: differences in MPE_sexman(class = 1st class), MPE_sexman(class = 2ndclass), MPE_sexman(class = 3rdclass),
# MPE_sexman(class = crew) ~ how to test the hypothesis? See Wooldridge 15.5.51 S. 570
# h0: MPE_sexman_crew = MPE_sexman_class3 = MPE_sexman_class4 = MPE_sexman_class5 = MPE_sexman
